# Machine Learning Course by Kylie Ying - FreeCodeCamp

This repository contains notebooks implementing the concepts covered in Kylie Ying's machine learning course, designed to introduce machine learning fundamentals in a beginner-friendly way. You'll find implementations of various machine learning algorithms and an introduction to TensorFlow for model building.

### ðŸ“œ Contents Overview

1. **Data Preparation & Introduction**:
   - Overview of machine learning essentials and dataset preparation using Google Colab.
2. **Supervised Learning**:
   - **Classification** (MAGIC Dataset): K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines
   - **Regression** (Bikes Dataset): Linear Regression using Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow
3. **Unsupervised Learning**:
   - **Clustering** (Seeds Dataset): K-Means Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
4. **Neural Networks**:
   - Introduction to TensorFlow, building classification and regression neural networks.

### ðŸš€ Getting Started

Each section of the course includes practical examples, available in these Google Colab notebooks.
